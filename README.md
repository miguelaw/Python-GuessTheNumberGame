# Guess TheNumber Game (Python)

## Description

This very simple Python game illustrates how simple is to [import](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html) built in methods, assign a value to a [variable](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types), check its value using [if statements](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html), and using [try except](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) to detect input errors and notify the user of the correct game parameters.

If the user does want to play the game, the game script continues while looping through the script and checking for condition win == false or win == true.

If the user tries to input an incorrect value type, the game will let the user know
